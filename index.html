       <h2 class="Basliq">Almost everyone has a fantasy that involves a super-cool car. Here's how to get behind the wheel.</h2>
       
       <span class="information1">The 1967 Chevy Corvette, the 1975 BMW 3.0 CSL, 
        any pre-1974 Porsche 911–these are some of the vehicles that have earned a significant place in automotive history. 
        Iconic yet accessible, they are museum-quality cars that you really just want to take for a spin. 
        These automotive legends have weathered the decades, but with some ingenuity, you can still get behind the wheel of most of them. 
        Here's our list of the ones worth the hunt.</span> <br>

            <h1 class="JG"> Jaguar E-Type</h1>

            <span class="information2">Once called "the most beautiful car ever made" by Enzo Ferrari, 
                the 1960s Jaguar E-Type is a classic sports car mainstay. 
                "If you only choose one car from this list to drive, this is the one," says McKeel Hagerty, CEO of Hagerty, 
                the world's largest provider of collector vehicle insurance. 
                This staple of British motoring history still has verve–it can perform up to 150 m.p.h. and brakes better than most cars from its era. 
                Visit the Jaguar Heritage Driving Experience program in Kenilworth, U.K., where you can pay for a day of driving the marque's classics.</span> <br>

               <h1 class="LM">Lamborghini Miura</h1>

               <span class="information3"> Considered by some to be the sexiest car ever built, 
                   the Miura debuted in 1966 as a sleek mid-engine speedster designed to challenge Ferrari. 
                   "Piloting the Miura transcends driving experience to become a life experience," Hagerty says. 
                   "If the sound of six carburetors feeding a thirsty, vibrating V-12 moored right behind your head isn't enough, 
                   it's also arguably the most beautiful car ever produced." To buy one, contact the Lamborghini Club America or an auction house like RM Sotheby's or Gooding & Co. 
                   They're usually in the know about the cars before they reach the general market.</span> <br>
